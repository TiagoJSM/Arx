LightRays 2D by Andrii Sudyn

To create new LightRays 2D object in your scene, click on GameObject 
menu in Unity window, then go to Effects and then click LightRays2D.

That's it, now you have a quad with LightRays tecture on it.
Now you can resize it, set the colors and adjust the sliders 
untill you achieve the desired effect.
